# Ideas
- dynamic target deflection based on spline curvature
- sensor is at an angle with the surface (i.e. the whisker is looking back)

# Experience
- target proportional to curvature is bad as slippage is likely to occur
  ( should not allow sudden deflection changes )
- body predictions (tip - offset(defl)) are not precise

# Viewer Control
