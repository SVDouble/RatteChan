    abstract = {Most mammals have sensory tactile hairs, also known as whiskers or vibrissae. Traditionally, whiskers are associated with diverse survival skills, including tactile discrimination, distance assessment, food acquisition, gap crossing, and social interaction. Vibrissae functions are processed in the somatosensorial cortex, commonly referred to as the barrel cortex. Hence, most of the whisker-related research has been focused on this cortical region. However, increasing evidence indicates that the vibrissal system modulates several aspects of hippocampal physiology. This graphical review aims to summarize cumulative evidence indicating that whiskers regulate the neural function and cellularity in several hippocampal subfields. Interestingly, lack of whiskers notably affects neuronal firing in CA1 and CA3 hippocampal subfields, alters spatial mapping, impairs navigational skills, modifies cytoarchitecture, and reduces the adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. This evidence extends our understanding of how whiskers are related to hippocampal function and offers insights to explore novel associations between whisker functions and neural plasticity in the hippocampus.}
