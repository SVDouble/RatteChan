\chapter{Experimental Setup}

To validate the proposed policies, we developed a framework comprising a simulation, tools for collecting metrics, and an automatic test runner.
It is based on the Mujoco physics engine, created by Google DeepMind, which provides a realistic simulation of contact dynamics.
The project is available on GitHub\footnote{\url{...}}.


\section{Swiping Policy} \label{sec:swiping-policy}

For the swiping policy, a single whisker executes a sweeping motion over the object.
Performance is quantified by evaluating the mean absolute error and the standard error in contour reconstruction, with each estimated point $\mathbf{y}_i$ matched to its closest reference point $\mathbf{x}_i$.

The estimated contour, $C_{\text{est}} = \{\mathbf{y}_i\}_{i=1}^N$, is determined by the control algorithm, which selects points based on whisker deflection and excludes those recorded during the whisking-back phase in retrieval.
The reference contour, $C_{\text{ref}} = \{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N$, consists of points on the object's surface, each being the closest match to the corresponding estimated point, and is derived from high-resolution sampling to serve as ground truth.

The absolute error is defined as $d_i = \|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{y}_i\|$, which is the Euclidean distance between the reference and estimated points.
To assess performance, we compute the mean absolute error
\[
    \bar{d} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} d_i,
\]
and the standard error
\[
    \sigma_d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^{N} (d_i - \bar{d})^2}.
\]
The mean absolute error represents the average distance between the reference and estimated points.

Figures~\ref{fig:experiment-disk-swiping}--\ref{fig:experiment-complex-object-swiping} display results for various objects.
Estimated contour points are colored green if their error deviates from the mean by less than the standard error, and red otherwise.
Red points indicate the most inaccurate measurements, corresponding to the worst 32 percentile of the error distribution.

\subsection{Contour Estimation of Disk and Rounded Rectangular Box}

    \label{fig:experiment-disk-swiping}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:experiment-disk-swiping} shows the contour estimation of a disk using the swiping policy.
The disk is the simplest object, and the whisker successfully reconstructs its contour with submillimeter accuracy.
No prominent red regions are observed, except for occasional deviations due to the disk's polygonal approximation.

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/experiments/rounded-rectangular-box-swiping}
    \caption{Contour Estimation of Rounded Rectangular Box With Swiping Policy}
    \label{fig:experiment-rounded-rectangular-box-swiping}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:experiment-rounded-rectangular-box-swiping} illustrates the contour estimation of a rounded rectangular box.
The rounded rectangular box is a more complex object with sharper corners, yet it shows a similar level of accuracy and mean error.

\subsection{Contour Estimation of Complex Object}

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/experiments/complex-object-swiping}
    \caption{Contour Estimation of Complex Object With Swiping Policy}
    \label{fig:experiment-complex-object-swiping}
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:experiment-complex-object-swiping} shows the contour estimation of a complex object.
Noticeable red regions appear at the inner inflections.
Since the inner angles are not smooth, the platform must quickly adjust to surface changes, which leads to a higher error rate.
At the initial moments, the whisker becomes overly deflected, causing the error to increase as the deflection model performs worse outside its normal operating range.
The mean error remains comparable to that observed for the disk and the rounded rectangular box.


\section{Retrieval Policy}

Figures~\ref{fig:experiment-octagon-edges-135deg-swiping-retrieval}--\ref{fig:experiment-wall-edges-90deg-swiping-retrieval} show results for different polygonal objects.
Let $k_{\mathrm{edge}}$ be the index of an edge point and $k_{\mathrm{retr}}$ the index of its corresponding retrieved point, with the same indexing for both events.
The following metrics evaluate the retrieval policy:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mean absolute error:} $\bar{d} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} d_i$, discussed in \cref{sec:swiping-policy}.
    \item \textbf{Mean retrieval radius:} $\bar{r} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N} \|\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{edge},j} - \mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{retr},j}\|$, where $\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{edge},j}$ is the $j$th edge point and $\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{retr},j}$ its corresponding retrieved point.
    \item \textbf{Mean retrieval distance:} $\bar{d}_{\mathrm{retr}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\sum_{i=k_{\mathrm{edge},j}}^{k_{\mathrm{retr},j}-1} \|\mathbf{r}^{t_{i+1}} - \mathbf{r}^{t_i}\|$, which calculates the trajectory length between the time of detachment and the time of retrieval, where $\mathbf{r}^{t}$ denotes the body position at time $t$.
\end{itemize}
In the plots, the edge points $\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{edge}}$ are shown as red crosses, while the retrieved points $\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{retr}}$ appear as black crosses.

The mean retrieval radius, defined as
\[
\bar{r} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N} \|\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{edge},j} - \mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{retr},j}\|,
\]
quantifies the proximity of a retrieved point to the edge, which is critical for accurately determining the edge direction.
A smaller $\bar{r}$ corresponds to a faster and more precise retrieval.
Ideally, this radius should be less than the distance between the whisker tip in its optimally deflected state (with $\delta=\delta_{\mathrm{target}}$) and its neutral state (with $\delta=0$), which is approximately 3\,cm.
The control algorithm sets the target mean retrieval radius to 1\,cm; values below 3\,cm are acceptable provided the contact angle remains within the desired range.

The mean retrieval distance, given by
\[
\bar{d}_{\mathrm{retr}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\sum_{i=k_{\mathrm{edge},j}}^{k_{\mathrm{retr},j}-1} \|\mathbf{r}^{t_{i+1}} - \mathbf{r}^{t_i}\|,
\]
measures the length of the trajectory from the time of detachment until the system resumes normal operation after retrieval.
A longer trajectory indicates more unnecessary movement, reducing the efficiency of the retrieval policy.
Note that for large, flat contact angles the whisker's overshoot may increase $\bar{r}$, even if the backward motion is not required to establish optimal contact.

The retrieval performance for the octagon with 135\degree{} edges is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:experiment-octagon-edges-135deg-swiping-retrieval}.
This object, with its high number of edges, demands a stable retrieval policy.
The octagon exhibits a mean reconstruction error of $1.1\,\text{mm} \pm 0.8\,\text{mm}$, comparable to the performance observed with the swiping policy.
It also has a mean retrieval radius of $20.9\,\text{mm} \pm 1.7\,\text{mm}$, which is about one quarter of the whisker length.
This radius is higher than the target of 1\,cm because fine adjustment of the whisker's position is unnecessary in this case.
The low relative standard deviation indicates high reproducibility.
The retrieval policy was triggered 8 times in total.

The retrieval on a box with 90\degree{} edges is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:experiment-box-edges-90deg-swiping-retrieval}.
The box’s sharper edges present a greater challenge for the whisker.
It achieves a mean reconstruction error of $0.7\,\text{mm} \pm 0.4\,\text{mm}$, demonstrating good performance.
It also has a mean retrieval radius of $11.2\,\text{mm} \pm 1.9\,\text{mm}$, which is close to the 1\,cm target while preserving retrieval consistency.

\end{figure}

The performance on a prism with 60\degree{} edges is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:experiment-prism-edges-60deg-swiping-retrieval}.
The prism yields a mean reconstruction error of $0.8\,\text{mm} \pm 0.6\,\text{mm}$, in line with the swiping policy.
It also has a mean retrieval radius of $8.8\,\text{mm} \pm 0.6\,\text{mm}$, approaching the target value.
However, an inflation in the trajectory is observed at the retrieved edges.
This is likely due to the transition between the undeflected and deflected states.
Such overshoot—especially when the whisker contacts the edge away from its tip—is necessary to accelerate deflection compensation during subsequent swiping.
It also helps minimize the platform’s rocking in the normal direction.
A more sophisticated deflection model that accounts for contact along the whisker shaft could potentially mitigate this effect.

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/experiments/prism-edges-60deg-swiping-retrieval}

\end{figure}

The wall experiment with 90\degree{} edges is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:experiment-wall-edges-90deg-swiping-retrieval}.
This scenario is challenging because the wall’s width is only 1\,cm, matching the target retrieval radius.
Nonetheless, the system achieves a mean retrieval radius of $10.2\,\text{mm} \pm 0.7\,\text{mm}$, nearly meeting the target.
This performance is partly due to the wall’s precise 1\,cm width, which limits the possibility of contacts farther away.
Video recordings confirm that the whisker tip is well-aligned and contacts the opposite edge accurately.
If the wall were about 25\% shorter, the policy could still handle it through deflection at the whisker’s shaft, provided the side length remains above a critical threshold.
Conversely, when the target radius is doubled, the platform executes a 180° turn to reach the edge, effectively rendering the wall undetectable.
In this case, the mean reconstruction error is $1.1\,\text{mm} \pm 0.6\,\text{mm}$, consistent with the performance of the swiping policy.
