\chapter{Experimental Setup}

To experimentally validate the proposed policies, we developed a simulation environment that emulates the whisker sensor system.
It is based on the Mujoco physics engine, developed by Google DeepMind, which provides a realistic simulation of the contact dynamics between the whisker and the object.
The controller is implemented in Python

\section{Swiping policy}
For swiping policy a single whisker performs a sweeping motion over the object.
The following metrics are considered for evaluation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mean Reconstruction Error:} The mean reconstruction error of the object's shape.
    \item \textbf{Average speed:} The average speed of the whisker during the swiping motion.
    \item \textbf{Critical angle:} The angle at which the whisker loses contact with the object and cannot recover automatically.
\end{itemize}
