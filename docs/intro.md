# RatteChan üê≠ Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the **RatteChan** project, where we explore tactile whisker-based navigation for robotics. This knowledge base will serve as a central hub for documenting the project's progress, challenges, and outcomes.

This project is part of an ongoing Bachelor's thesis and aims to investigate the potential applications of whisker-inspired tactile sensing in environments where traditional sensors like cameras and LIDAR are less effective.
