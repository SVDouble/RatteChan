# RatteChan üê≠ ‚Äî Whisker-Based Tactile Navigation System

This repository contains the research and documentation for **RatteChan**, a whisker-based tactile navigation system inspired by biological sensing. The project involves designing and testing an array of whisker sensors to simulate how rats navigate in complex environments.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a robotic system capable of navigating using tactile sensors inspired by animal whiskers. The documentation includes research findings, design iterations, simulation results, and code for the tactile sensor system.
